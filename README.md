# JS-map-NY-inspections

Mapbox GL JS project. 
Using mapbox and javascript and NYC open data, I made a map project which will show locations of all the places that may have failed inspection or have been issued a warning only in New York. 
There are a few little features such as, change map theme/style/layer and clickable locations so you can get the information on the place you clicked.
More features will be coming soon
